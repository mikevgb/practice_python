# This exercise is Part 1 of 3 of the Hangman exercise series. The other 
# exercises are: Part 2 and Part 3.

# In this exercise, the task is to write a function that picks a random 
# word from a list of words from the SOWPODS dictionary. Download this file
# and save it in the same directory as your Python code. This file is Peter
# Norvigâ€™s compilation of the dictionary of words used in professional 
# Scrabble tournaments. Each line in the file contains a single word.

# Hint: use the Python random library for picking a random word.

import random

word_file = [line.strip() for line in open('30_sowpods.txt', 'r')]

print(random.choice(word_file))
