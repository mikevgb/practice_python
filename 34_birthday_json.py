# This exercise is Part 2 of 4 of the birthday data exercise series. The other
# exercises are: Part 1, Part 3, and Part 4.

# In the previous exercise we created a dictionary of famous scientists’ 
# birthdays. In this exercise, modify your program from Part 1 to load the 
# birthday dictionary from a JSON file on disk, rather than having the 
# dictionary defined in the program.

# Bonus: Ask the user for another scientist’s name and birthday to add to the
# dictionary, and update the JSON file you have on disk with the scientist’s
# name. If you run the program multiple times and keep adding new names, your
# JSON file should keep getting bigger and bigger.

import json

with open("34.json", "r") as file_js:
	data = file_js.readlines()
	print(json.dumps(data, indent=4, sort_keys=True))
