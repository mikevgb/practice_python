# In the previous exercise we counted how many birthdays there are in each month 
# in our dictionary of birthdays.

# In this exercise, use the bokeh Python library to plot a histogram of which 
# months the scientists have birthdays in! Because it would take a long time for
# you to input the months of various scientists, you can use my scientist 
# birthday JSON file. Just parse out the months (if you donâ€™t know how, I 
# suggest looking at the previous exercise or its solution) and draw your 
# histogram.

# need to import at least 3 things to make your
# bokeh plots work
