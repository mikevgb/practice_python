# This exercise is Part 3 of 3 of the Hangman exercise series. The other 
# exercises are: Part 1 and Part 2.

# You can start your Python journey anywhere, but to finish this exercise
# you will have to have finished Parts 1 and 2 or use the solutions (Part
# 1 and Part 2).

# In this exercise, we will finish building Hangman. In the game of Hangman,
# the player only has 6 incorrect guesses (head, body, 2 legs, and 2 arms)
# before they lose the game.

# In Part 1, we loaded a random word list and picked a word from it. In Part
# 2, we wrote the logic for guessing the letter and displaying that 
# information to the user. In this exercise, we have to put it all together
# and add logic for handling guesses.

# Copy your code from Parts 1 and 2 into a new file as a starting point. Now 
# add the following features:

# Only let the user guess 6 times, and tell the user how many guesses they 
# have left.
# Keep track of the letters the user guessed. If the user guesses a letter 
# they already guessed, donâ€™t penalize them - let them guess again.
# Optional additions:

# When the player wins or loses, let them start a new game.
# Rather than telling the user "You have 4 incorrect guesses left", display 
# some picture art for the Hangman. This is challenging - do the other parts 
# of the exercise first!
# Your solution will be a lot cleaner if you make use of functions to help 
# you!
